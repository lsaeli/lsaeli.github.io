      <p class="blurred">heat through the soles of her stockings and beneath <span>The fabric</span> -covered cardboard of her belt. She touched the silver metal <span>of</span> its buckle, breathed in to gain a moment's <span>space</span> between fabric and flesh. Across the street a deli and a bar and a podiatrist's office shared a squat brick building that <span>was shaded by</span> trees. Beyond it a steeple rose-the gray steeple of the Presbyterian church-into a sky that was blue and cloudless. Swinging from the bus-stop sign, the children failed to imagine for their mother, just as they had failed to imagine for the building where they went to school, any other life but the still and predictable one she presented on those <span>Morning</span>s, although even as she dropped her <span>cigarette</span> to her side and stepped on the butt with her first step toward them (it was a woman's subtle, sneaky way of finishing a <span>smoke</span>) she was aware of the stunned hopelessness with which she moved. Oftime draining itself from the scene in a slow leak. Briefly terrified, <span>the</span> younger girl took her mother's hand as the bus wheezed toward the curb. Even the <span>swift</span>, gritty breeze that rushed through the slices of open window seemed at this hour to be losing the freshness of morning-some <span>Cool air clung to it</span>, but <span>in</span> patches and <span>tatters</span>, as if the coming heat of the afternoon had already begun to wear through. The children squinted their eyes against <span>it</span> and shook back their hair. Watching the houses go by, they were grateful that theirs was not one of them to be left, after each stop, in the <span>Expelled gray exhaust, and</span> as the bus moved past the cemetery <span>they felt</span>-all un<span>conscious</span>ly-the eternal disappointment <span>of</span> the people whose markers lay so near the road. Who saw (because they imagined <span>the dead</span> to be at eye level with the ground, the grass pulled like a blanket up to their noses) the walking <span>living through</span> the <span>black</span> stakes of the iron fence and the <span>Filtered</span> refuse of what seemed many <span>summers</span>-ice-cream
