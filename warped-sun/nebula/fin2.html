<h6>We apologize.<br><br>The engine isn't functioning properly. We are being drawn towards Earth's orbit. Fortunately, we are close enough to see Earth's demise without burning up in the atmosphere or gamma rays. We deeply apologize for the detour. However, we do advise you take caution. Although you have downloaded and reviewed the emergency procedure in your memory synapse, we will broadcast it again.

<br><br>
Ensure your seat belt is fastened, make sure seatback and tray table are upright and locked position. 
<br><br>
Four oxygen masks will drop from the compartment overhead. To activate the flow of oxygen, pull down on the mask until the plastic tubing is fully extended. Place the mask over your nose and mouth and breathe normally. 
<br><br>
Secure the mask with the elastic strap. Although oxygen will be flowing, the plastic bag may not inflate. Continue wearing the mask until otherwise notified by a crew member.

Thank you for your attention. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of your flight.
