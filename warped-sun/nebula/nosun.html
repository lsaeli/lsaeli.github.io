<h6>You didn't look out the window. It was hard stay focused on your screen with all the people around you clamoring to look outside. It's a good thing you paid extra for Nebula-class. At least no one is climbing over you to see the last of Earth. The supernova outside burst into a brilliant blue light with millions of waves of solar flares. It was definitely picture worthy. But no matter, there are thousands of other explosions in space, and the planet was just a rock anyway. There are many others to explore.
