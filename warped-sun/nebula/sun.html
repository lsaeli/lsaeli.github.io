<h6 id="sun">From afar, you watched the sun swallow the Earth.<br><br>On one hand, you had the best seat to watch with that wide window of yoursâ€”your eyes could even zoom and have the supernova fill your entire line-of-sight. There is no room for words. The explosion was grand and shattered light into millions of tiny flares, like a big firework. Well, except it destroyed Earth. Your screen reassured you that there are many other planets to conquer. Earth's loss is negligible. The last group of homo sapien sapiens left it a mess. No wonder they colonized Mars.<br><br>At least you left Earth.</h6>
