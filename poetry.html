<h2>Stolen Corpses, Sewn<h2>


<p>Their spines were stolen<br>

Ripped by a wicked blade covered in white. <br>
The dagger seared through the muscle<br>
Fraying fibers and forgotten old skin. <br><br>

Then the spines were sewn onto a new body <br>
Plastered with abysmal frozen ink and rewritten histories<br>
With skin carefully reshaped by an ivory bone. <br><br>

The book weaver had finished.
