<h1>Twelve is enough to reboot the universe.</h1>

<p>1 ly = 9.5 Ã— 10^12 km = 63,240 AU.


Twelve is spiritual and releases ever-flowing energy throughout our universe, echoing in all dimensions. It represents the star sign Pisces, and shows the completed cycle of reincarnation. After all the suns die and scatter their stardust, the universe condenses this energy again until it is reborn.<br><br>Here, you've been bestowed with your own universe. Do with it what you will.
<br>
<br>
How much of the world will you sacrifice to bend reality?
You have twelve celestial bodies to bend, break, or burst.
