<p>I chose the wrong allies.<br><br>

Now all I see are wild skies<br>
And dances with broken ghouls <br>
Whose hearts have dried.<br><br>

The melted gold revealed brass<br>
I was taken by fluorescent gas<br>
Viewing the inside with broken eyes<br>
That showed me a shattered sunrise.<br><br>

I peel the skin and there is nothing under<br>
Except glass, ripped seams<br>
And pale empty dreams.<br><br>

I see the vibrations stretch before me<br>
In great mountainous waves<br>
That crystalize the molten sea.<br>
Flowing out to touch life from old graves.<br><br>

I dare to forget the tragedy,<br>
Deleting the impossible year.<br>
Rebirthing the crushed memory<br>
Of the man whose name was smeared.<br><br>

Once he lost his ruby crown,<br>
All he could do is countdown<br>
Until the media forced him to drown.<br><br>

His voice silenced, no innocence found.<br>
